const [errorMessage, setErrorMessage] = useState('');

The preceding example uses array destructuring, which is a standard JavaScript
feature that allows developers to retrieve values from an array and immediately
assign them to variables or constants.

As always, MDN
provides great resources for that (see http://packt.link/3B8Ct for array
destructuring, https://packt.link/hGjqL for information on the let variable,
and https://packt.link/TdPPS for guidance on the use of const .)
